## 🟡 Level 3 — Orange Belt: payLoyal: Smart Escrow Payroll & Loyalty Rewards Protocol

payLoyal is a production-grade, decentralized payroll escrow and builder loyalty rewards protocol built on the Stellar network using Soroban smart contracts. It enables employers to fund payroll streams inside an autonomous escrow environment, secure milestone delivery, and programmatically distribute payments to contractors while automatically minting loyalty point tokens to reward contribution volume.

---

## Architecture Diagram

The following Mermaid diagram shows the overall system flow from the client application through the wallet manager, contract coordinator, and blockchain ledger.

    EscrowContract -->|Inter-Contract Call| LoyaltyContract[LoyaltyToken Registry Contract]
    LoyaltyContract -->|Reward Points| UserPoints[(Contractor Points Store)]
```

---

## Smart Contract Design

The protocol is split into two co-dependent Soroban smart contracts to enforce clear separation of concerns, secure funds custody, and modular governance:

1. **Escrow Payroll Contract (`payment-logger`)**:
   - Manages agreement state transitions: `Created (0)` &rarr; `Funded / Active (1)` &rarr; `Completed (2)` / `Cancelled (3)`.
   - Safely locks employer-deposited tokens in the contract address and releases them to the contractor upon employer signature validation.
   - Triggers cross-contract executions to award loyalty tokens.
   - Features contract upgrade capabilities controlled strictly by the administrative role.

2. **Loyalty Token Registry (`loyalty-token`)**:
   - Maintains account-level loyalty points balance mappings in instance storage with automatic TTL extension.
   - Restricts adding points to authenticated, authorized contract addresses (like `payment-logger`) and administrative accounts.
   - Provides point burn/redemption mechanics signed by the point owner.
   - Features contract upgrade capabilities.

---

## Inter-Contract Communication Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor Employer
    participant Escrow as PaymentLogger Contract
    participant Token as Stellar Asset Contract
    participant Loyalty as LoyaltyToken Contract
    actor Contractor

    Employer->>Escrow: create_agreement(employer, contractor, token, amount, title)
    Employer->>Escrow: fund_agreement(agreement_id)
    Token->>Escrow: Transfer amount (locked in escrow)
    Employer->>Escrow: release_payment(agreement_id)
    Escrow->>Token: Transfer amount to Contractor
    Escrow->>Loyalty: add_points(caller, user, amount)
    Note over Loyalty: Verifies caller is authorized issuer
    Loyalty->>Contractor: Mint points (1 LP per 10 tokens released)
```

---

## Features

- **Custom Storage Structures**: Uses typed Soroban structures for payroll agreements and key configurations.
- **Advanced Access Control**: Employs role-based checks, administrative owner overrides, and strict verification logic.
- **Inter-Contract Routing**: Demonstrates secure contract-to-contract message calls and permission verification.
- **Transaction State Machine**: Tracks pending, processing, confirmed, and failed transactions locally.
- **StellarWalletsKit Integration**: Supports Freighter, Albedo, Hana, and Lobstr wallets with network auto-switching capabilities.
- **Mobile Responsive Design**: Clean dark-mode dashboard usable on desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: Rust, Soroban SDK (v26)
- **Frontend Core**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Service Queries**: React Query
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Soroban Mock SDK

---

## Local Development

### 1. Smart Contract Setup & Tests

To run smart contract tests locally:
```bash
# Run tests for all workspace contracts
cargo test --workspace
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

Ensure you have Node.js 18+ installed. Install dependencies and start the local development server:
```bash
# Install packages
npm install --ignore-scripts

# Start Next.js development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_HORIZON_URL=https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_ESCROW_CONTRACT_ID=CA2CPOMEE7EBGSSVU62T6HLG44WDOVEZAGTQGVW3KGV6PJ62R765IJEJ
NEXT_PUBLIC_LOYALTY_CONTRACT_ID=CCIWJOKEYK623T4O72D6Q3W4H5LSPYCRQ6Z47VQDTRMEYV3JCPXU636F
```

---

## Testing

To run the frontend test suite:
```bash
# Run Vitest test suite
npm run test
```

---

## CI/CD Pipeline

The pipeline uses GitHub Actions to verify pull requests and automate deployments.

1. **Pull Request Workflow (`pr.yml`)**:
   - Checks out repository
   - Installs Rust and builds WASM contracts
   - Executes Cargo contract tests
   - Installs Next.js dependencies and runs Vitest unit tests

2. **Deployment Workflow (`deploy.yml`)**:
   - Triggered on merges to the `main` branch
   - Compiles and tests smart contracts
   - Builds Next.js production bundles and uploads to server environments

---

## Security Considerations

- **Input Sanitization**: Client forms validate addresses and positive decimals before transaction construction.
- **Authentication Safeguards**: All state-modifying smart contract calls require explicit `require_auth` checks on the employer signature.
- **Authorized Issuers Only**: The `loyalty-token` contract only mints points when invoked by approved addresses present in contract storage, preventing malicious point inflation.
- **Contract Code Upgradability**: Code updates are governed strictly by the admin key utilizing secure WASM hash upgrades.

---

## Contract Addresses

- **Escrow Payroll Contract ID**: `CA2CPOMEE7EBGSSVU62T6HLG44WDOVEZAGTQGVW3KGV6PJ62R765IJEJ`
- **Loyalty Registry Contract ID**: `CCIWJOKEYK623T4O72D6Q3W4H5LSPYCRQ6Z47VQDTRMEYV3JCPXU636F`

### Deployment Verification

- Verified against the Stellar Testnet Soroban RPC: the escrow contract address above responded successfully to a live simulation call.
- The loyalty and resolver defaults currently shown in the app should be replaced with valid deployed contract IDs if you want full multi-contract verification.

---

## Transaction Hash

- **Sample initialization transaction hash**: `5df7e47265bf87e974acdae98d7ceb9706e2a222378a5e4d29388dfba4a8f9cd`
